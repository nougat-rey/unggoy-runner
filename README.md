# unggoy-runner

Game built using the pygame library. Play as an unggoy (grunt) from the Halo universe as it tries to evade the flood infection form coming after it. Try to survive as long as possible.

## Run Instructions

```
cd code
python main.py
```

## Game Instructions

+ Press Space to jump
+ Press Return to return to main menu
+ Press 7 to enter secret level

## Motivation
I've been a fan of the Halo universe since I was a kid, and I always had a soft spot for the grunts. I especially loved their commentary and thought it'd be funny to build a game around these little fellas.
